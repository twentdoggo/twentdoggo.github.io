# twentdoggo.github.io
My own website.
I mess around with this to help learn how to code.
I mainly mess around with this at my high school when I have nothing else to do during my study hall.
Hopfully I can actually make this website kind of worthwhile.

# pages you can look at
1. Home
Just the basic homepage of the site.
2. Quote Today
A little project me and my friend made for 8th grade.
3. Links
A page full of useful links.
4. Feedback
Send me suggestions and I might do them.
5. Discord
Most of the time I am on discord, so you can talk with me there.
6. (Not on the nav bar)
https://twentdoggo.github.io/project/
Just where I mess around with some embeds and what I wanna add to the site.
